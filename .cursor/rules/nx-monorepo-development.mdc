# Nx Monorepo Development Rules

## Project Structure
This is an Nx monorepo with the following structure:
- `apps/company-website/` - Main React application
- `libs/shared/ui/` - Shared UI components (shadcn/ui)
- `libs/shared/utils/` - Shared utilities and hooks
- `libs/shared/types/` - Shared TypeScript types
- `libs/shared/data-access/` - Supabase client and API calls
- `libs/company-website/features/` - Company website specific components

## Development Commands
Use these commands for development:
- `yarn nx serve company-website` - Start development server
- `yarn nx build company-website` - Build for production
- `yarn nx lint company-website` - Run linting
- `yarn nx graph` - Visualize project dependencies

## Import Paths
Use these path aliases for imports:
- `@company-web/shared/ui` - UI components
- `@company-web/shared/utils` - Utilities and hooks
- `@company-web/shared/types` - TypeScript types
- `@company-web/shared/data-access` - Supabase integration
- `@company-web/features` - Feature components

## Library Development
When working with libraries:
- Always use path aliases, not relative imports
- Update library index.ts files when adding new exports
- Test library builds: `yarn nx build shared-ui`
- Libraries should not have circular dependencies

## TypeScript Configuration
- Base configuration: `tsconfig.base.json`
- App configuration: `apps/company-website/tsconfig.app.json`
- Development configuration: `tsconfig.dev.json`
- Each library has its own tsconfig.json

## Best Practices
1. Keep libraries focused and single-purpose
2. Use proper dependency management in project.json
3. Test builds after making changes
4. Use Nx graph to understand dependencies
5. Follow the established import patterns
